This is a reproduction case for a bug in the [chrome.tabGroups.move()](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/reference/tabGroups/#method-move) API method.

### Description of the bug:

When trying to move one tab-group right next to another tab-group,
you might get the following exception message in the extension console log:

```
Uncaught (in promise) Error: Cannot move the group to an index that is in the middle of another group.
```

While for certain cases this error would make absolute sense,
in the particular scenario that is reproduced in the `background.js` code,
this error should NOT be thrown and the group should be moved successfully instead.

‚ö†Ô∏è See the comments in the [background.js](background.js) file for the details about the bug.
